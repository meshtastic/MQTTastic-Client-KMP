/**
 * Applies platform-specific TLS trust configuration to the [TLSConfigBuilder].
 *
 * On Android, this installs a hostname-aware trust manager that satisfies
 * `NetworkSecurityTrustManager`'s requirement for the 3-arg
 * `checkServerTrusted(chain, authType, hostname)` overload when
 * `network_security_config.xml` contains domain-specific configurations.
 *
 * On JVM and native targets, this is a no-op — the platform default suffices.
 *
 * @param serverName the TLS server name (SNI hostname), or `null` for IP literals.
